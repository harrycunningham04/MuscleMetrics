Muscle Metrics
This is a workout plan creation and analysis tool for the user. So that they can track their progress and see how their workouts are progressing. While being able to see how close to achieving their goals they are.

Description
The main user would be a fitness enthusiast who wants to track their progress and see how their workouts are progressing. They would be able to create a workout plan that has a goal of the weight they want to lift on three different exercises. This would then create a graph of the weight they are currently lifting and the goal they are trying to achieve. This would allow the user to get the best results from their workouts from knowing the weights they need to be lifting to reach their goals in the time frame that they have set for themselves. The site would be able to track the user's progress and allow them to rate their workouts to see how they felt after each one. They can also see videos of how to do the exercises and how to do them correctly, and the user can also see how many reps they are doing and how many sets they are doing for every exercise in every workout.
